Ribbon lover theme for Anchor CMS. It's also for red, black, white lover.

## How To Use It
First thing first, I make this using SASS plus Compass.
So in case you want to modify the css, you need to prepare SASS and compass environment first.

For the theme itself, you need to set custom variable from your Anchor admin page. The variable you need to set is this:
- logo_image : insert your image URL relative to your site URL (example : img/logoimage.png)

## Diary
After a day looking into Anchor CMS, due to its simplicity. It only took one day again to actually make a theme for it. Actually we don't need documentation since the code itself is the documentation.

## Future Improvement
For now it's not mobile friendly yet. I don't like my css code messed up because using responsive css framework (you know, it's a bit frustrating when you need to cascade everything!). I also still don't have idea for mobile appearance for this theme.
